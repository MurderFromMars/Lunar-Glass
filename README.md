## Technology Highlights

- **Bash Automation:** orchestrates builds, configuration, and deployment

  Lunar Glass uses inline JavaScript via `qdbus6` to:
  - Remove live Plasma panels
  - Set wallpapers programmatically
  - Interact with KDE Plasma APIs directly

- **Source Builds:**
  Components like `KDE Rounded Corners`, `Better Blur DX`, `Kurve`, and `Plasma Panel Colorizer` are built from source for performance and stability.

- **Auto Rebuild Hooks for KDE Rounded Corners & Better Blur DX:**
  Lunar Glass ensures compatibility after KWin updates:
  - **Arch:** pacman hook executes `/usr/local/bin/rebuild-kwin-effects.sh` post-kwin upgrade
  - **Debian/Ubuntu:** APT post-invoke hook triggers rebuild if kwin packages were updated
  - **Fedora:** DNF post-transaction action triggers rebuild on kwin-wayland install/update
